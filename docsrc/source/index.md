autorino is a tool for _Assisted Unloading, Treatment & Organisation of RINex Observations_  üõ∞Ô∏è üåê ü¶è 

## Introduction

The _autorino_ package (for _Assisted Unloading, Treatment & Organisation of RINex Observations_) is designed for
automated download and conversion of GNSS raw data from the main manufacturers‚Äô receivers 
(Leica, Septentrio, Topcon, Trimble, and BINEX) based on their respective official conversion utilities. 
A special focus is put on conversion to RINEX3/4 and near real-time capability (download frequency up to 5 min).

_autorino_ aims to perfom the four following tasks:
1. **Download** GNSS raw data from remote GNSS receivers
2. **Conversion** of GNSS raw data to RINEX3/4 format using official conversion utilities from the main GNSS manufacturers.
3. **Handle** RINEX files (e.g., merging, splitting, splicing, etc.) using dedicated utilities.
4. **Metadata edition** of RINEX files (e.g., modifying header metadata, renaming filenames, editing comments, etc.) 
based on _autorino_'s spinoff tool [_rinexmod_](https://github.com/IPGP/rinexmod).
